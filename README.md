Hi! You've stumbled upon my music production experiments with the Chuck programming language.

I'm learning music production and music theory using the Chuck programming language and watching [Clint Hoagland's Creating Electronic Music with ChucK Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-9SSIBe1phI_r3JsylOZXZyAXuEKRJOS&si=71Q3e2hfUkRw7Sqf)

## This repo contains:
- Loading files with Chuck
- Oscillators
- Loading scores
- Converting MIDI to frequency
- Music theory (some..)
- Major & minor scales
- Chords
- _other music stuff_ (_very descriptive, I know.._)
